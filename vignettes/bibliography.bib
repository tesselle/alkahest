  abstract = {Particle size, scatter, and multi-collinearity are long-standing problems encountered in diffuse reflectance spectrometry. Multiplicative combinations of these effects are the major factor inhibiting the interpretation of near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectra. Sample particle size accounts for the majority of the variance, while variance due to chemical composition is small. Procedures are presented whereby physical and chemical variance can be separated. Mathematical transformations—standard normal variate (SNV) and de-trending (DT)—applicable to individual NIR diffuse reflectance spectra are presented. The standard normal variate approach effectively removes the multiplicative interferences of scatter and particle size. De-trending accounts for the variation in baseline shift and curvilinearity, generally found in the reflectance spectra of powdered or densely packed samples, with the use of a second-degree polynomial regression. NIR diffuse reflectance spectra transposed by these methods are free from multi-collinearity and are not confused by the complexity of shape encountered with the use of derivative spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {X-ray diffraction scans consist of series of counts; these numbers obey Poisson distributions with varying expected values. These scans are often smoothed and the Kα2 component is removed. This article proposes a framework in which both issues are treated. Penalized likelihood estimation is used to smooth the data. The penalty combines the Poisson log-likelihood and a measure for roughness based on ideas from generalized linear models. To remove the Kα doublet the model is extended using the composite link model. As a result the data are decomposed into two smooth components: a Kα1 and a Kα2 part. For both smoothing and Kα2 removal, the weight of the applied penalty is optimized automatically. The proposed methods are applied to experimental data and compared with the Savitzky–Golay algorithm for smoothing and the Rachinger method for Kα2 stripping. The new method shows better results with less local distortion. Freely available software in MATLAB and R has been developed.}

  abstract = {Most baseline problems in instrumental methods are characterized by a smooth baseline and a superimposed signal that carries the analytical information: a series of peaks that are either all positive or all negative. We combine a smoother with asymmetric weighting of deviations from the (smooth) trend get an effective baseline estimator. It is easy to use, fast and keeps the analytical peak signal intact. No prior information about peak shapes or baseline (polynomial) is needed by the method. The performance is illustrated by simulation and applications to real data.},

We have proposed several improvements of the SNIP algorithm. Moreover, we have extended and generalized the SNIP algorithm for multidimensional coincidence γ-ray spectra. In addition to the continuous background, the so-called lower-order coincidences, i.e., coincidences peak-background in different dimensions, must also be included into the estimated background. Further, we have derived a set of modifications of the algorithm that allow estimation of specific shapes of background and ridges as well.},
